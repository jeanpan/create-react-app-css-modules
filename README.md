This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## react-css-modules-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for create-react-app with css-modules. It also proivdes you to use SCSS for the css-modules. 

Be noted that this is an __ejected__ create-react-app, which removes the single build dependency, but all the commands except `eject` will still work. Know more about [eject](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#converting-to-a-custom-setup).
